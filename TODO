do the setup.py thing so that fts can be installed in /usr/local/bin

tool/option to add/sync specific files

After adding exclusions, we tell them that they need to resync. But we should
also automatically remove DB items that they've just now excluded (so that they
only have to resync on *removing* an exclusion)

After a search we tell the user if the files are out of date or missing, but we
don't tell them if there are new files in the directory that we haven't indexed.
Should we check for that?

On a search, get matchinfo and optionally display/highlight matches

cmdline switches to display the full path instead of the relative path on a
search

a python test suite instead of this silly shell script

track file hashes so that we can avoid reindexing renamed files?

there are some definite performance advantages to combining 'files' and
'files_fts', not least of which is that the search operation wouldn't require a
join. Should look into this.

do we need a metric for relevance or to sort the results?

--and and --or for multiple searches

should version the schema

unicode safety

on --init, a warning for shadowing a parent .fts.db

should a 'simple' exclusion ignore both directory components and filenames? or
do we need separate types for that?

should searching check the exclusions DB?
